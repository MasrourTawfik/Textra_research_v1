# Autonomous Braking System via Deep Reinforcement Learning

**Main Objective**: Develop an autonomous braking system using deep reinforcement learning to enhance safety in autonomous vehicles

**Key Contributions**:
- Proposes a novel autonomous braking system based on deep reinforcement learning
- Develops a reward function balancing accident risk and efficient vehicle reaction
- Demonstrates the system's effectiveness in various uncertain environments

**Introduction to Autonomous Braking Systems**
==============================================

### Key Points

* **Importance of Safety in Autonomous Driving**: Ensuring safety is paramount for fully autonomous driving vehicles, which must perceive environments and control movements to prevent accidents.
* **Limitations of Conventional Rule-Based Braking Systems**: Traditional rule-based autonomous braking systems are inadequate for handling the vast array of real-world scenarios, often leading to either premature or delayed braking.

### Main Message
The necessity for **Intelligent Autonomous Braking Systems** that can adapt to unpredictable situations, providing both safe and comfortable brake control, is underscored by the shortcomings of conventional approaches.

### Synthesis
Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on the integration of safety features to navigate through unforeseen, risky situations effectively. Among these, **Autonomous Braking Systems (ABS)** play a crucial role in automatically reducing vehicle velocity upon detecting threatening obstacles. However, as highlighted by Chae et al. (2017) in their proposal for a deep reinforcement learning-based ABS, conventional rule-based systems are inherently limited in their ability to handle the complexity of real-world driving scenarios.

> *"[Conventional autonomous braking systems] are limited in handling all scenarios that can happen in real roads."* - Chae et al. (2017)

This limitation necessitates the development of more sophisticated, **intelligent braking systems** capable of adapting to various unforeseen circumstances, thereby enhancing the overall safety and comfort of autonomous driving experiences.

**Technical Approach to Autonomous Braking System Development**
-----------------------------------------------------------

### Key Methodological Contributions

* **Formulation of Braking Control as a Markov Decision Process (MDP)**: 
	+ State: Relative position of obstacle and vehicle's speed
	+ Action Space: Discrete brake actions (no braking, weak, mid, strong braking)
* **Design of Reward Function for Optimal Braking Policy**:
	+ Balances damage minimization in case of accident and reward for swift risk evasion

### Synthesized Insight
The proposed technical approach, as outlined in [Content: 1702.02302v2](#), leverages Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn an optimal braking policy within the defined MDP framework. This methodology enables the development of an intelligent autonomous braking system capable of adapting to uncertain environments, thereby enhancing safety in autonomous driving scenarios.

### Key Findings

* **Effective Pedestrian Safety**: The proposed autonomous braking system successfully maintains a safe distance from pedestrians in various uncertain environments.
* **Efficient Learning Process**: The system's deep Q-network (DQN) converges effectively using replay memory, enabling reliable brake control.

### Empirical Evidence Supporting System Efficacy

Studies, such as Chae et al. (2017) [^1], demonstrate the autonomous braking system's capability to avoid collisions without mistakes. By formulating brake control as a Markov decision process (MDP) and utilizing DQN, the system learns to balance damage minimization and risk avoidance. Experimental results in urban road scenarios with pedestrian crossings showcase the agent's desirable control behavior.
