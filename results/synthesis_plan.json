It is related to the text passage as it visually summarizes the components and interactions within the system. The figure is divided into two main sections: 'Agent' and 'Environment'.\n\n\nThe 'Agent' section includes a 'Brake control' component, which is symbolized by a brake pedal icon, and a 'State Reward' component, which is represented by a dollar sign. These elements are connected by arrows indicating the flow of information and actions. The 'Agent' interacts with the 'Environment', which is depicted with a car and a pedestrian, symbolizing the driving scenario. The 'Environment' is also connected to a 'Sensor fusion' component, which is represented by a gear icon, indicating the integration of sensor data.\n\n\nThe main elements and structure of the figure include the 'Agent' and 'Environment', the 'Brake controller', the 'Sensor fusion', and the 'Drive' component within the 'Environment'. The key metrics or patterns shown are the flow of actions and rewards between the 'Agent' and the 'Environment', which is indicative of the reinforcement learning process. The mathematical or algorithmic aspects are not explicitly detailed in the figure, but the concept of state rewards and actions suggests a feedback loop where the agent learns to optimize braking based on the environment's response.\n\n\nThe research impact of this system is significant as it contributes to the development of autonomous vehicles by providing a framework for implementing deep reinforcement learning in real-world driving scenarios. The figure illustrates the practical application of the proposed system, showing how it can potentially improve safety and efficiency in autonomous driving.",

It is placed in the context of the text passage, which discusses the importance of designing a reward function for a reinforcement learning model to determine the appropriate braking action for a vehicle when a pedestrian crosses the street. The figure serves as a visual aid to help understand the dynamics of the interaction between the vehicle and pedestrian, which is crucial for the context of the text.\n\n2. Technical Analysis:\nThe main elements of the figure include the vehicle, pedestrian, pedestrian crossing trigger point, vehicle position, vehicle velocity, and time interval. The vehicle's position and velocity are shown before and after the pedestrian crosses the trigger point, indicating the vehicle's reaction to the pedestrian's presence. The time interval is represented by a horizontal dashed line, with the action taken by the vehicle (acceleration) shown as a vertical dashed line. The reward function is not explicitly shown, but it is implied that it would be based on the vehicle's response to the pedestrian's crossing, balancing the penalty for accidents and the reward for quick reaction.\n\nKey metrics or patterns shown include the vehicle's velocity before and after the pedestrian crosses, the trigger point, and the stop line. The mathematical or algorithmic aspects are not directly shown, but the figure implies the need for a reward function that considers the time interval (\u0394T) and the action taken by the vehicle (A_t) to determine the desirable braking action.\n\n3. Research Impact:\nThe figure illustrates the critical moment of a pedestrian crossing and the vehicle's response, which is central to the research's objective of finding a reward function that balances the risk of accidents with the efficiency of the vehicle's reaction. The research aims to train a Deep Q-Network (DQN) to learn the optimal braking action based on the vehicle's speed and the pedestrian's position. The figure helps to visualize the scenario and the factors that need to be considered when designing the reward function, which is a key contribution to the methodology and results of the research.",

This visual data is crucial for understanding the dynamics of the system being analyzed, which is likely related to a vehicle-pedestrian interaction scenario. The figure complements the text passage by offering a graphical depiction of the concepts discussed, such as the velocity of the vehicle and the action trajectory, which are essential for understanding the context of the replay memory and optimization process mentioned in the text.\n\n2. Technical Analysis:\nThe figure consists of three graphs:\n\n- The first graph shows the longitudinal position of the vehicle and pedestrian over time, with the vehicle's position represented by a red line and the pedestrian's position by a blue line. This graph indicates that the vehicle's position remains constant while the pedestrian's position increases linearly over time.\n\n- The second graph displays the velocity of the vehicle over time, with the velocity represented by blue circles. The velocity starts at a higher value and gradually decreases, suggesting that the vehicle is slowing down over time.\n\n- The third graph illustrates the action trajectory, which is a bar graph showing the deceleration of the vehicle over time. The bars increase in height from 0 to 6 seconds, indicating that the vehicle's deceleration increases as time progresses.\n\nThe figure's structure, with its clear labels and distinct colors, allows for easy interpretation of the data. The key metrics shown are the position, velocity, and deceleration of the vehicle, which are essential for understanding the system's behavior.\n\n3.

The use of replay memory and the optimization of parameters through stochastic gradient descent are indicative of advanced techniques in machine learning.

          "description": "The table presents data on two different scores, CVFA and CVNA, across various initial velocities (vinit) measured in kilometers per second (km/s). The initial velocities range from 20 km/s to 60 km/s, and the scores are numerical values that likely represent some form of assessment or rating at each velocity.\n\nHere is a summary of the key data points and findings from the table:\n\n- For both CVFA and CVNA scores, the values start at 1 for the lowest initial velocity of 20 km/s and increase to 3 for the highest initial velocities of 40 km/s and 45 km/s.\n- After reaching the peak score of 3, both scores decrease back to 1 at the highest initial velocity of 60 km/s.\n- The scores for CVFA and CVNA are identical at each initial velocity, suggesting that the two scores are related or that the assessment criteria for both are the same.\n\nThe surrounding text appears to be related to a different context, possibly discussing a neural network model for a DQN (Deep Q-Network) and its training parameters. It mentions a fully-connected layer with five hidden layers, the use of the RMSProp algorithm, a learning rate of 0.0005, and the number of position data samples used as a state set to 5. It also references a replay memory size of 10,000 and a trauma memory size of 1,000.\n\nThe text seems to be discussing the organization of data, critical findings, and research value, but without additional context, it's difficult to provide a detailed analysis of the findings or their significance.",
